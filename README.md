Usage
The attendance management system is a command-line application. To use it, simply navigate to the project directory and run the ./attendance-management-system command.

The application will prompt you to select an option. You can choose to register as a teacher, log in as a teacher, or view the help menu.

If you choose to register as a teacher, you will be prompted to enter your name and username. The application will then create a new teacher account for you.

If you choose to log in as a teacher, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. The application will then authenticate your login and provide you with access to the teacher menu.

The teacher menu allows you to create subjects, add students to subjects, take attendance, and generate attendance reports.

To create a subject, simply select the "Create Subject" option and enter the subject name. The application will then create a new subject for you.

To add students to a subject, select the "Add Student to Subject" option and enter the student ID of the student you want to add. The application will then add the student to the selected subject.

To take attendance, select the "Take Attendance" option and select the subject for which you want to take attendance. The application will then prompt you to enter the attendance status for each student.

To generate an attendance report, select the "Generate Attendance Report" option and select the subject and date for which you want to generate the report. The application will then generate a CSV file containing the attendance data for the selected subject and date.
